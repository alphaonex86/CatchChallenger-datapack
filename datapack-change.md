== Why merge shop/fight/industry into the map file? ==
Most shop/fight/industry is unique, then greatly simply the map creation, you don't have to edit/create 5 files (reduce size and XML tag by 20x), creation time of advanced bot (shop/fight/industry): 10min to 15s

== Bot id unique by map ==
Was so hard find unique id over whole datapack
Don't imply performance lost on server because it generate their own dictionary and manipulate unique id as internal

== Dedupliction ==
All is duplicate, you can't change a value and all the bot is impacted, but was case near never used
You can search in all file and change the value automatic or manual way

== Quest ==
NoW bot id is folder/map/botid

== condition for door ==
local on map file
